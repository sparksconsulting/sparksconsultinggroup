        <p>Your spreadsheets contain clues about revenue opportunities you're currently missing. Underpriced products. Underutilized customers. Inefficient operations. These insights are buried in your data, waiting to be discovered.</p>

        <h2>Where the Money Hides</h2>
        <p>Revenue opportunities hide in several places: pricing analysis (products selling below margin targets), customer analysis (high-value customers being under-served), product mix analysis (high-margin products being de-emphasized), and operational efficiency (unnecessary costs in fulfillment or support).</p>

        <h2>A Real Example</h2>
        <p>One client discovered that 30% of their "best-selling" product line actually operated at breakeven or below. They were pouring effort into products that didn't generate profit. By reallocating that effort, they increased overall margins by 18% without raising prices or cutting service.</p>

        <h2>How to Start Looking</h2>

        <h3>Analyze Your Pricing</h3>
        <p>Compare what you're charging against your actual costs. Are some customers getting significantly better prices than others for the same service? That's often an untapped pricing opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Segment Your Revenue</h3>
        <p>Break down revenue by product, customer, channel, and region. You'll likely find that 80% of your profit comes from 20% of your offerings or customers. That's where to focus.</p>

        <h3>Look for Inefficiencies</h3>
        <p>Track operational costs by product or customer. Some customers might require disproportionate support. Some products might have high fulfillment costs. These are opportunities for optimization or repricing.</p>

        <p>The data you need is likely already in your spreadsheets. Let's help you find it.</p>
